        "Project 667A, or as known mostly as the Soviet submarine K-219, went missing in 1986. It housed an estimated 34 nuclear warheads and happened to be one of the most controversial submarine incidents during the Cold War.<br/>",
		"<br/>",
        "The submarine suffered a major internal explosion and fires within, causing casualties along the way. The seal in the missile hatch cover failed, causing ocean water to leak inside and react with residue from the missile’s liquid fuel.<br/>",
		"<br/>",
        "The Soviet Union claimed that the leak was caused by a collision with the submarine USS Augusta, but cited no real source of information. Both the US Navy and even the commander of K-219 denied any collision took place.<br/>",
		"<br/>",
        "Ultimately, the vessel sank to 18,000 feet.<br/>",
		"<br/>",
        "Two years later in ’88, the Soviet ship Keldysh positioned itself over K-219 and discovered that several missile silo hatches were found forced open which once had the nuclear warheads they contained were gone.<br/>",

        "No one has any information on the whereabouts of these missing 34 warheads.<br/>",
